my_friend = "Cuneyt"

I have seen ${my_friend} two days at car dealership. ${my_friend} was trying to purchase a car with his friend.
I advised ${my_friend} not to buy Toyota and instead buy BWM. ${my_friend} accepted my advice and bought BMW next day.

var.variable_name



resource "aws_instance" "web" {
    ami = var.ami
    instance_type = var.instance_type
}

resource "aws_instance" "web2" {
    ami = var.ami
    instance_type = var.instance_type
}

    ami = var.ami
    instance_type = var.instance_type
}

resource "aws_instance" "web4" {
    ami = var.ami
    instance_type = var.instance_type
}

resource "aws_instance" "web5" {
    ami = var.ami
    instance_type = var.instance_type
}


Variables:
